#The self-driving car challenge


The self-driving car challenges in this season are Time Attack races: there will not be multiple
cars at the same time on the track. Instead, one car per attempt will try to achieve the best time
by driving several laps fully autonomously

##Open Challenge: The vehicle must complete three (3) laps on the track with random placements
of the inside track walls

##Obstacle Challenge: The vehicle must complete three (3) laps on the track with randomly placed
green and red traffic signs. The traffic signs indicate the side of the lane the vehicle must follow.
The traffic sign to keep to the right side of the lane is a red pillar. The traffic sign to keep to the
left side of the lane is a green pillar. The vehicle should not move any of the traffic signs. After
the robot completed the three rounds, it has to find the parking lot and has to perform parallel
parking.
